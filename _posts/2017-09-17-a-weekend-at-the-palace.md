>Spent the weekend at the palace <br/>
>Of high hopes <br/>
>And all the restless <br/>
>And frequent dopes. <br/>
>Time looses its linearity <br/>
>Mutlidimensional connections <br/>
>Black holes and singularity <br/>
>Are frequent emotions. <br/>
>Because bodies are frequent <br/>
>But personalites are sparse. <br/>
>As people came and went, <br/>
>One made me see stars <br/>
>In this cloudy sky. <br/>
>Clearing the heavens <br/>
>Lending love and light <br/>
>To all that happens.
