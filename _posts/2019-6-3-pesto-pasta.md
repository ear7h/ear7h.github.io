Pesto Pasta
(originally by Harry Baker)

> I like pasta.
>
> I’d like some pesto pasta.
>
> They’d be purple pesto pasta. Maybe pop-up purple pesto pasta.
>
> Proper pop-up purple pesto pasta.
>
> “How do you prop up pop-up purple pesto pasta?”
>
> I hear you cry. Well I …
>
> I’d probably prop up proper pop-up purple pesto pasta
>
> With a proper pop-up purple pasta pestoclip,
>
> But I’d pre-prepare appropriate adhesives as alternatives,
>
> A cheeky pack of Blu Tack just in case the pesto slipped.
>
> Because I could build a pop-up metropolis.
>
> But I wouldn’t wanna deal with all the pesto pasta politics.
>
> Pesto politicians with their pesto-thin policies,
>
> Broken promises without appropriate apologies.
>
> There’d be a little pesto me. And a little pesto you.
>
> And we could watch pesto TV and it would all be pay-per-view.
>
> We’d see the poppy pesto rappers rap about their pesto package
>
> Or watch pesto pasta carriers get stuck in pesto traffic on the A4. Pesto.
>
> There’d be a pesto princess Kate but we’d all stare at pesto Pippa,
>
> And then we’d all live in fear of killer Jack the Pesto-Ripper,
>
> Because the pesto propaganda propagates the pasta’s prejudices,
>
> Pestos printing pictures of the photogenic terrorists.
>
> A little pesto me. And a little pesto you.
>
> And in a pop-up population pasta’s problems pop up too.
>
> There’d be a pompous pesto parliament who remained out of touch,
>
> And who ignored the pasta’s protests about all the pesto cuts,
>
> Then the peaceful pesto protests would get blown to pesto pieces,
>
> By the confetti cannons manned by pre-emptive police.
>
> And yes there’d still be pesto money, so there’d still be pesto greed,
>
> And the pesto piggy bankers pocketing more than they need,
>
> Purchasing the potpourri to pepper their pesto properties,
>
> Others live in poverty and ain’t acknowledged properly.
>
> A proper poor economy where so many are proper poor,
>
> But while their needs are ignored the money goes to big wars.
>
> Origami armies unfold plans for pesto planes
>
> And we remain imprisoned in our own pesto chains,
>
> But the greater shame is that it always seems to stay the same,
>
> What changes is who’s in power choosing how to lay the blame,
>
> They’re naming names, forgetting these are names of pasta,
>
> Because in the end it all comes down to pasta.
>
> I like pasta.
>
> ’Cause even when the situation’s dire,
>
> It is only ever pasta who are able to inspire,
>
> And on pesto, it’s hard to see how we all cope.
>
> But in the bottom of Pandora’s box there’s still hope,
>
> And I still hope ’cause I believe in pasta.
>
> Pasta like my grandparents.
>
> Who every single day since I was born, have taken time out of their morning to pray for me.
>
> That’s 7892 days straight of someone checking I’m okay, and that’s amazing.
>
> Pasta like my aunt who puts on plays with prisoners.
>
> Pasta who are capable of genuine forgiveness.
>
> Pasta like the persecuted Palestinians.
>
> Pasta who go out of their way to make your life better, and expect nothing in return.
>
> You see, pasta have potential to be powerful.
>
> Just because the pasta in power tend to pretend to be victims
>
> We don’t need to succumb to that system.
>
> And a pesto population is no different.
>
> There’s a little pesto me. And a little pesto you.
>
> And in a pop-up population pasta’s problems pop up too,
>
> But even if the whole world fell apart then we’d still make it through.
>
> Because we’re pasta.
