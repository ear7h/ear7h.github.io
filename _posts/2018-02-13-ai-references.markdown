Some references for machine learning. Mostly having to do with learning concepts (back propagation, gradient descent) or language implementation.

## [Very Basic Intro to Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DG5-UyRBQD40)
Good video for intro into the suject.

## [Jeff Heaton - Neural Network Training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVJOseIJnww)
Good series. Easy to understand mathematics behind training the network.

## [TensorFlow website](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/)
Installation guide and tutorials. Currently, the tutorials push the new `tf.estimator` way of doing things. This gives the ability to quickly make very powerful ML models.

## [tf-regression](https://github.com/ear7h/tf-regression)
This short program used to be one of the first of the TensorFlow tutorials. It is simple to understand where "learning" is taking place
