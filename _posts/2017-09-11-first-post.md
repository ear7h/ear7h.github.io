There have been several iterations of this site and this will be the least tempory so far, but still planned to be temporary.

Let's try some javascript

<button id="abutton">Click me</button>

<script>
b = document.getElementById('abutton')

b.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
	alert('you pressed a button')
})
</script>
