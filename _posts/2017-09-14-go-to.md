Recently I learned that Go has `goto` statement, which I have been using more and more. It is very restricted which keeps you from becoming string-like Italian foods. The two restrictions are prequite simple:
* Cannot jump variable declarations
* Labels share the same *scope* properties as local variables

The following two examples will fail to compile

``` go
func main() {
	goto Label
	x := 1 //variable declaration
Label:
	print("hello")
}

```

```go
func main() {
	goto Label

	if true {
		Label: //not in local scope
	}

	print("hello")
}
```

## So what are good uses?

I find that when working with RESTy API's it makes it easy to paginate and search.

This following function comes from a program to retrive stock prices. It is made to answer the question, "When can the next trade happen?"

``` go
func getMarketHours() (time.Time, time.Time) {

	//nasdaq hours on a specific day
	url := "https://api.robinhood.com/markets/XNAS/hours/" + time.Now().Format("2006-01-02") + "/"
	//tag for goto statement
L:
	//get today's market info
	resp, err := http.Get(url)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	defer resp.Body.Close()

	byt, err := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	var m map[string]interface{}

	err = json.Unmarshal(byt, &m)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	//if the market is open on fetched day and the close time is in the future
	//then parse time strings
	if m["is_open"].(bool) {
		openTime, err := time.Parse(time.RFC3339, m["opens_at"].(string))
		closeTime, err := time.Parse(time.RFC3339, m["closes_at"].(string))
		if err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}

		if closeTime.After(time.Now()) {
			return openTime, closeTime
		}

	}
	//else get the next open hours
	url = m["next_open_hours"].(string)
	//and fetch again
	goto L
}

```

The sigle question is really a compound question: "Is the market open right now? If not, when will it be?" This translates to two states, `marketIsOpen` and `marketIsClosed` and different behaviour on those two *states*.

This is where the goto statement prevails, statewise behavior, and the exectuation stack provides more liabilities than benefits. Take a command line puzzle game, where you have to walk around rooms collecting items to win. An easy approach could be to keep calling functions for new rooms with the collected items

``` go
//number of items in the game
const NUM_OF_ITEMS = 7

//roll credits
func doEndSequence(){...}

//get user input
func getInput() string {...}

//returns true if the string is in the array
func hasItem() string {...}


func room1(items []string) {
	for true {
		//get input
		ui := getInput()
		
		//rooms and directions
		if ui == "north" {
			return room2()
		}
		...

		//item
		if ui == "hammer" {
			if len(items) == NUM_OF_ITEMS {
				doEndSequence()
				os.Exit(0)
			}

			if !hasItem(items, "hammer") {
				items = append(items, "hammer")
			}
		}
	}
}

func room2(items []string) {
	for true {
		//get input
		ui := getInput()
		
		//rooms and directions
		if ui == "south" {
			return room1()
		}
		...

		//item
		if ui == "id card" {
			if len(items) == NUM_OF_ITEMS {
				doEndSequence()
				os.Exit(0)
			}

			if !hasItem(items, "id card") {
				items = append(items, "id card")
			}
		}
	}
}

func main() {
	room1([]srting{})
}

```

The program makes sense, when you enter a room you either go to a different one or pick up an item. But, the program will eat up more and more memory every time you enter a new room. Functionnal programming is not the paradigm to for this game. The programm will be stateful where the room and item list specify the number of states. Using `goto` the program can be written in more memory saving manner:

``` go
//number of items in the game
const NUM_OF_ITEMS = 7

//roll credits
func doEndSequence(){...}

//get user input
func getInput() string {...}

//returns true if the string is in the array
func hasItem() string {...}

func main() {
	items := []string{}
	ui := ""
	goto Room1

Room1:
	//block scope to be able to maintain variables organized
	{
		//get input
		ui = getInput()
		
		//rooms and directions
		if ui == "north" {
			goto room2
		}
		...
	
		//item
		if ui == "hammer" {
			if len(items) == NUM_OF_ITEMS {
				doEndSequence()
				os.Exit(0)
			}
	
			if !hasItem(items, "hammer") {
				items = append(items, "hammer")
			}
		}
	
		//loop back
		goto Room1
	}

Room2:
	//block scope to be able to maintain variables organized
	{
		//get input
		ui = getInput()
		
		//rooms and directions
		if ui == "south" {
			goto room1
		}
		...

		//item
		if ui == "id card" {
			if len(items) == NUM_OF_ITEMS {
				doEndSequence()
				return
			}

			if !hasItem(items, "id card") {
				items = append(items, "id card")
			}

		}

		//loop back
		goto Room2
	}

	...
}

```

This example works with nothing more than the simplest primative types, and that is its beauty. However, such a long main function might seem unconvenional. And perhaps upon reading the description of the program, it would make more sense to use more complex types, such as the hash table:

``` go

//number of items in the game
const NUM_OF_ITEMS = 7

//roll credits
func doEndSequence(){...}

//get user input
func getInput() string {...}

//returns true if the string is in the array
func hasItem() string {...}


func room1(items *[]string) {
	//get input
	ui := getInput()
	
	//rooms and directions
	if ui == "north" {
		return "room2"
	}
	...

	//item
	if ui == "hammer" {
		if !hasItem(items, "hammer") {
			*items = append(*items, "hammer")
		}
	}

	return "room1"
}

func room2(items *[]string) {
	//get input
	ui := getInput()
	
	//rooms and directions
	if ui == "south" {
		return "room1"
	}
	...

	//item
	if ui == "id card" {
		if !hasItem(items, "id card") {
			*items = append(*items, "id card")
		}
	}
}

func main() {
	rooms := map[string]func(*[]string)string {
		"room1": room1,
		"room2": room2,
		...
	}

	items := &[]string{}
	ui := "room1"

	for len(items) != NUM_OF_ITEMS {
		ui = rooms[ui](items)
	}
}

```

This program seems a lot more consise and perhaps the natural choice in an object oriented evroment.


## Moral of the story

`goto` is an handy tool for stateful programs which can be overshadowed by newer paradigms. Not without reason, the newer ideas become popular for a reason. Althogh one of the most popular UX elements of the last decade is essentially a `goto` statement in disguise: `<a href="...">`
